# DataAnalyticsProjects

This will be a series of steps to get to an machine learning project.
First we will have to do some preprocessing to enumerate the data and put it in a form which is readable for the computer.
Second step will be getting to know the data by doing standard EDA procedures including some further intressting analysis.
The third and last step will be building one or some machine learning models to predict certain values and to make use of 
the data by bringing value to a real life ITSM problem.
